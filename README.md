My cybersecurity homelab with Splunk, Nessus, Metasploit, and more.
# Security Lab

This is my personal cybersecurity homelab to gain hands-on experience with:
- Splunk (SIEM)
- Nessus (Vulnerability Scanning)
- Metasploit (Exploitation)
- Kali Linux (Offensive Security)
- Ubuntu (Monitoring Tools)
- Proxmox (Virtualization Environment)

## Goals
- Detect attacks using Splunk and SIEM rules
- Simulate exploits with Metasploit and DVWA
- Scan and assess vulnerabilities with Nessus
- Document each tool's role in the lab

## Notes
- Hosted on Proxmox
- Token-based GitHub commits from Kali Linux
