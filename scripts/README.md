# Custom Scripts

This folder contains custom or modified scripts created during lab exercises to automate scans, brute force attempts, and other common tasks.

## Examples
- quick-nmap-scan.sh: Automates Nmap service detection scans
- Wordlist generators or wrappers for Hydra

Scripts are written for speed, repeatability, and real-world simulation.
